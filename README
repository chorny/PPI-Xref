PPI::Xref is a Perl module for generating cross-references of Perl code.

You do need PPI and Sereal installed.

At the moment, sub definitions are detected, and use/no/require/do are
recursively followed.  You can query things like the subs defined and
where in the code exactly (file, line, even colum), package declarations
seen, and so forth.

util/ppixref is a command-line frontend utility for using PPI::Xref.

Note that if you want to use the caching feature (and you should) you
need to create the cache directory first.  For testing, just example:

  mkdir /tmp/cache

and then

  ppixref ... --cache_directory=/tmp/cache ...
